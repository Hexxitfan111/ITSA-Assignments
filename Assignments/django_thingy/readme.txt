To Teacher:
I attempted to do the whole personalization thing. Most of the personalization is limited to HTML/CSS files. I have made some changes in the .py files, but for the most part my attempts at naming things differently from the tutorial resulted in the entire thing breaking.

As far as HTML files go, If you want to view the actual english text translations then copy/paste into google translate should work. (Unless you speak german)

WARNING: As the less than reliable google translate was used to get the german phrases in the first place, it may not translate back in the correct manner or even a reasonably similar manner. Of course, unless we are being graded on grammatical accuracy this should not matter. Also, most links have been intentionally left in English for ease of navigation.
