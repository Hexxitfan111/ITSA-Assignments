Welcome the third distortion of the original animal_thing zoo project. This paragraph is written before the project is completed. Anyways, this time the code for animal_thing will likely have been mutilated into an unrecognizable form in order to work with the Django framework. As a result, until the newest distortion is complete refer to the previous versions of animal_thing.
