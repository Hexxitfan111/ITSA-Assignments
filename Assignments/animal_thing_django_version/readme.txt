Welcome the third distortion of the original animal_thing zoo project. This paragraph is written before the project is completed. Anyways,
this time the code for animal_thing will likely have been mutilated into an unrecognizable form in order to work with the Django framework.
As a result, until the newest distortion is complete refer to the previous versions of animal_thing.

Finally, complete!
Django is fun to use, but it sure is confusing when it starts spitting out random errors that string through 50 files and make it near
impossible to actually tell where or what the error is.
Anyways, screenshots of my admin pages are in the screenshots folder.
Project is obviously in the zoo folder.
