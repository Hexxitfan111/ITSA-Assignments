The imoprtant files here are all of the .py files, and animals.txt, enclosures.txt, and neighbors.txt

The other files are a partially completed second zoo, which can be enabled by changing the file paths in the .py files.

Edit function of the the zoo is currently nonfunctioning and will render whichever file is opened in it unusable. Making a backup of the important files is recommended before attempting to use the editor.
